Installing the app



In order to install this app and run it on a device there are a few step you must follow, once you have downloaded the folder.

You must be on a mac with an up to date version of Xcode installed and have an apple ID.

Due to this app being a working prototype it has not been tested on multiple devices it is advised that you run this app on an modern Ipad
running the latest iOS. This app has been designed as an iPad app but for the purpose of testing it will run on all iOS devices
the quality of the app on any device other than iPad with a screen size of 10.7 cannot yet be guaranteed.

Please see .... for example videos of how the app should run.


Step One

First open up the terminal and navigate (cd) to the app folder.

next, run pod install.

Providing this has worked you can move onto the next step.


Step Two

Now you must open the open the Xcode workspace file, there is a workspace file and a project file in order to use the frameworks 
you must open the workspace file.

Once you have opened the file you will need to select a signing team in the app settings under 720Synth and then general.

if you do not have a signing team available I have included some links below to information on how to do set one up with your apple ID this.
